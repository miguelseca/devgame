## About the Project

Dev Game is a collection of mini-games and applications built using modern React practices, with a focus on React Hooks. These projects serve as practical exercises to help learners understand and implement the following concepts:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

- useState for managing state in function components
- useEffect for handling side effects like fetching data
- useContext for managing global state
- useReducer for handling complex state logic
- useMemo and useCallback for performance optimization
- Whether you are looking to sharpen your React skills or are a beginner in the world of hooks, this project has something for everyone!

## Mini Projects

The course is broken down into several small projects, each targeting specific React Hooks. Some of the projects include:

- Todo Project: A task management app utilizing useState and useEffect (/tasks).
- Image Gallery: A simple image gallery section built using useContext for theme toggling (/gallery).
- Jokes API: An app that fetches and displays jokes from a public API using useEffect (/jokes).
- Dev Game: This main project is still under development.

Each project is designed to be a standalone feature, allowing you to explore each React Hook independently.


## Technologies Used

This project is built using modern web development technologies:

Next.js: A powerful React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
NextUI: A React UI library that provides beautiful, customizable components for building modern interfaces quickly.
